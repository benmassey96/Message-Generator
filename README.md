# Random message generator

The random message generator itself uses JavaScript to select a random index from 3 different arrays, and combines them to make a string. It's all put together in the index.html file and styled with the CSS file.

The topic of my random message generator is capital cities and heads of state.
It is intentionally incorrect as it's supposed to be random.
